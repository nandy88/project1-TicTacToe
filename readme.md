TIC-TAC-TOE

A classic game played with colors!!!

1) Planning

    Please refer to plan image ("5.png")

    I originally planned to have a very simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe with the following mock up

        Game Title 
        Player prompt (who's turn it is)
        Gameboard
        Reset Button
        Game Result (P1 Win, P2 Win or Draw)
        Score Card


2) HTML

    The HTML markup was very straight forward and was the first step in constucting the backbone of my website and game. Once the structure was set for my main elements, I began giving all the moving parts "classes" and "IDs". This was to allow me to later use JavaScript and CSS to make the page one interactive and colorful.  

3) CSS

    This is a feature of web development which i will definately need to research and practice more. 
    
    Being new to programming, I chose to use very basic structure in order for me to visually see what changes I was making as I further developed the project. Once I was happy with the basic set up, I began using Javascript to make the game playable. 

4) Javascript

    This was easily the area which I believe I struggled with the most when I got to the finer details like setting conditions for switching the player, having a draw result and not allowing any further moves once a winner had been decided. 
    
    By using internet resources I tried to gain an understanding of how others had made similar games using the same technologies and found various methods of creating my own version. My first attempt was made without fine-tuning my logic in my approach and quickly I came to a roadblock where I was unable to progress. I essentially had a page full of winning combination conditions written out individually and the code was unnessesarily long. Due to the clutter, I could not visualise how to move forward and began liasing with fellow students and my course instructors to modify my approach. A lot of discussions were had and I began applying learned knowledge to simplify the logic.

5) Biggest Issues and What to do Differently

    My biggest issues were the following:

        creating funtions for switching players
        creating a check for the draw
        not allowing any further moves once a winner had been decided


    What  would do differently

        Rather that rushing into development, I need to refine my approach to solving a problem. During the course of this project I understood that I had all the tools I required to complete this but wasn't thinking about how to use them. I feel with better planning, I will increase my attention to detail and be able to come up with solutions more readily.

            Tools such as:

            Elements
            Console
            Arrays
            Loops
            Functions (where condditions are located in the funtion)
            Storing Variables
